# Simple E-Commerce Project

Welcome to the Simple E-Commerce project! This project is currently in progress and is being developed in two main parts: the client and the server. The backend operations for product management and multi-role authentication have been implemented as described in the specifications. The client folder is currently empty, indicating that the frontend part of the project has not been developed yet.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into two main folders:

- **client:** The frontend part of the project.
- **server:** The backend part of the project, including product management and authentication with multi-role support.

## Backend Development

The server folder contains the backend development of the project. The following features have been implemented:

- **Product CRUD Operations:** The basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing products have been implemented.

- **Multi-Role Authentication:** The authentication system has been set up with multi-role support. Users can register, login, and their roles can be toggled between 'user' and 'admin'. JWT (JSON Web Token) is used for authentication.

## Frontend Development

The client folder is currently empty and has not been developed yet. This is where the frontend part of the project will be implemented.
